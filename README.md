This repository was created during the summer of 2024 as a work-in-progress project to evaluate and test the current quality and ease of implementation of Google and IBM Speech-to-Text APIs. It is not a fully polished product but serves as a sandbox for personal experimentation with these APIs to assess their real-world performance, accuracy, and developer experience.

Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is to:

Compare Google and IBM's Speech-to-Text APIs in terms of accuracy, response time, and handling of different audio qualities.
Analyze the ease of integration and implementation into web-based or Node.js applications.
Test real-world scenarios involving multiple speakers, accents, and noisy environments.
Status
As of now, the repository is in a semi-raw state, with many features and components either partially implemented or undergoing active development. The current state allows basic testing of the APIs, but more robust error handling, advanced features, and optimizations are still in progress.

Features
Initial integration with Google Speech-to-Text API and IBM Watson Speech-to-Text API.
Basic transcription functionality for testing different audio inputs.
Minimal UI/CLI for triggering API calls and displaying transcriptions.
Future Improvements
Enhanced UI for easier interaction and comparison of API results.
Integration of additional features such as speaker identification, punctuation handling, and timestamping.
Optimization for handling larger audio files and streaming capabilities.
